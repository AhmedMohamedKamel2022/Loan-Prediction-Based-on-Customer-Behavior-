# Loan-Prediction-Based-on-Customer-Behavior
This is my completed data science project as a data scientist from loading data to build a website.

# About
the organizations wants to anticipate potential defaulters for a consumer loan product. They have data about historical customer behavior based on what they have observed. Hence, when they acquire new clients, they want to predict who is riskier and who isn't. Therefore, this application is designed to help identify the behavior of new customers.

The project has built using  decision tree algorithm with an accuracy of 91%, and we did not use random forest because the size of the model is very large to build web application in heroku.
